KOGE stands for Kotlin-oriented Gradle Essentials, a concise self-study handbook for Gradle. I don't intend to write a book that is only elaborated by me, nor a collection of "Awesome Gradle" projects. It lists a dozen of confusing points for newcomers, points out the learning sequence, and links to appropriate reference materials - from questions, source code, and samples already available on the Internet.

The handbook chooses Kotlin as the language for DSL script and plugin development. The Gradle Kotlin DSL gets excellent support of IDE code completion, active community, as an Android developer I prefer unified workflow on one language for both App and build tools development. The links and use cases in this handbook, while referred to the Android development, are intended to be easy to understand for Gradle users of other platforms as well.

In terms of the scope for "Essentials", it covers point 1 and a few of point 2 below. (They are mastering levels of Gradle and Android build-tools development.) You will not be afraid to read/modify scipts anymore with the help of KOGE, and get to know how to create a simple task/task action, and efficiently manage the project.

> 1. "Basic usage only": I'm able to modify `build.gradle(.kts)`, and  the understand concept of Gradle lifecycle and tasks.
> 2. "Automation Optimization": I'm able to add additional scripts/tasks to optimize the build flow, the CI/CD, the maintainability, etc.
> 3. "Extend build functionality": I'm able to add complex tasks or Gradle plugins to extend build functionality such as annotation processor, bytecode transformer, and anything that enhances Gradle or platform plugins(Java/Kotlin/Android).
> 4. ...
