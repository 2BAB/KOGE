# KOGE Introduction

KOGE stands for Kotlin-oriented Gradle Essentials, a concise self-study handbook for Gradle. I don't intent to write a book that is only elaborated by me, nor is a collection of "Awesome Gradle" projects. It lists a dozen of the most confusing points of doubt for newcomers, points out the learning sequence, and links to appropriate reference materials - from questions, source code, and samples already available on the Internet.

The handbook chooses Kotlin as the language for DSL script and plugin development. Though Gradle Groovy DSL has better performance than Kotlin DSL, the latter provides excellent code-completion experience, an active community and ecosystem, and as an Android developer I prefer unified workflow on one language (both App and build tools development). The links and use cases in the handbook, while referred to the Android development, are intended to be easy to understand for users from other platforms as well.

In terms of the scope for "Essentials", it should cover the point 1 and few of point 2 below. (They are basically mastering level of Gradle and Android build-tools development.) You will not be afraid reading / modifying scipts any more, and get to know how to create a simple task / task action, how to manage the project in an efficient way.

> 1. "Basic usage only": I'm able modify `build.gradle(.kts)`, and  the understand concept of Gradle lifecycle and tasks.
> 2. "Automation Optimization": I'm able to add additional scripts/tasks to optimize the build flow, the CI/CD, the maintainability, etc.
> 3. "Extend build functionality": I'm able to add complex tasks or Gradle plugins to extend build functionality such as annoation processor, bytecode transformer, and anything that enhances Gradle or platform plugins(Java/Kotlin/Android).
> 4. ...
